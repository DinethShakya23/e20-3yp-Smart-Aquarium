</p>

To revolutionize aquarium care by introducing intelligent systems that ensure a healthy, stress-free environment for aquatic life, enhancing convenience for fish owners.

To develop an innovative, automated solution that simplifies aquarium management by providing real-time monitoring, intuitive control, and insights into the health and well-being of fish.

Maintaining optimal conditions in a fish tank requires constant attention, making it time-consuming and challenging, especially for beginners and those with busy schedules. Since fish cannot communicate their needs or health status, owners often remain unaware of issues until itâ€™s too late.

## 1. Problem Domain

- Inconsistent Environment Management
- Time-Consuming Maintenance
- Overfeeding and Underfeeding
- Lack of Early Problem Detection

## 2. Our Solution

- Real-Time Monitoring: Sensors track water parameters such as temperature, pH levels, and turbidity, ensuring a stable environment.
- Automated Control: The system automates feeding and temperature regulation, reducing manual intervention for users.
- Fish Behavior Monitoring: Detects irregular fish movements and alerts users to potential health issues.
- Alert Systems: Continuously monitors the aquarium and sends notifications to users if unfavourable conditions arise.
