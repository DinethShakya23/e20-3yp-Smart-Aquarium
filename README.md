To revolutionize aquarium care by introducing intelligent systems that ensure a healthy, stress-free environment for aquatic life, enhancing convenience for fish owners.

To develop an innovative, automated solution that simplifies aquarium management by providing real-time monitoring, intuitive control, and insights into the health and well-being of fish.

Maintaining optimal conditions in a fish tank requires constant attention, making it time-consuming and challenging, especially for beginners and those with busy schedules. Since fish cannot communicate their needs or health status, owners often remain unaware of issues until it‚Äôs too late.

## Problem Domain

- Inconsistent Environment Management
- Time-Consuming Maintenance
- Overfeeding and Underfeeding
- Understanding fish health and environmental conditions is challenging

## Our Solution

- Real-Time Monitoring: Sensors track water parameters such as temperature, pH levels, and turbidity.
- Automated Control: The system automates feeding and temperature regulation, reducing manual intervention for users.
- Live video streaming: Users can view the aquarium from anywhere anytime.
- Fish Behavior Monitoring: Detects irregular fish movements and low Oxygen levels notify users to potential health issue.
- Alert Systems: Continuously monitors the aquarium and sends notifications to users if unfavourable conditions arise.
